# Data-Cleaning-Project
# The script create data sets for 5 questions:

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set -> data
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement -> mean_sd
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set -> newData
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names -> for all
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject -> new_data
